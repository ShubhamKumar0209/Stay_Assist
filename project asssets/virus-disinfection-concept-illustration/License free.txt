# Given data
wages <- c(15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60)  # Midpoints of class intervals
workers <- c(31, 47, 59, 78, 104, 113, 81, 60, 52, 25)  # No. of workers

# Calculating mean
mean_wage <- sum(wages * workers) / sum(workers)

# Calculating median
cumulative_freq <- cumsum(workers)
total_workers <- sum(workers)
median_class <- wages[which(cumulative_freq >= total_workers / 2)[1]]
median_wage <- median_class  # Approximation (could be more detailed with class intervals)

# Calculating mode (using modal class approximation)
modal_class <- wages[which.max(workers)]
mode_wage <- modal_class  # Approximation

# Output
